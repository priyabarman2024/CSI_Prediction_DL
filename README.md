# CSI_Prediction_DL
Channel State Information (CSI)  prediction for Massive MIMO system using different types of Deep Learning techniques like CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer and also hybrid models in Python. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, SMAPE and also include heatmap visualization.
## Features
- Data preprocessing with NumPy and Pandas
- Feature engineering for CSI-related parameters
- Regression models using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using MSE and RÂ² score

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and run the notebook:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csi-prediction.git
